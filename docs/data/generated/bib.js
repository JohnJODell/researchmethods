        "abstract": "A brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) gives those suffering from neuromuscular impairments a means to interact and communicate with their surrounding environment. A BCI translates physiological signals, typically electrical, detected from the brain to control an output device. A significant problem with current BCIs is the lengthy training periods involved for proficient usage, which can often lead to frustration and anxiety on the part of the user. Ultimately this can lead to abandonment of the device. The primary reason for this is that relatively indirect measures of cognitive function, as can be gleaned from the electroencephalogram (EEG), are harnessed. A more suitable and usable interface would need to measure cognitive function more directly. In order to do this, new measurement modalities, signal acquisition and processing, and translation algorithms need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, using non-invasive near-infrared imaging technology to develop a user-friendly optical BCI. As an alternative to the traditional EEG-based devices, we have used practical non-invasive optical techniques to detect characteristic haemodynamic responses due to motor imagery and consequently created an accessible BCI that is simple to attach and requires little user training.",

The ultimate goal of BCI research is for the user to be able to communicate functional intent directly through thoughts. In this paper we propose an NIRS-BCI paradigm based on directly decoding neural correlates of decision making, specifically subjective preference evaluation. Nine subjects were asked to mentally evaluate two possible drinks and decide which they preferred. Frequency domain near-infrared spectroscopy was used to image each subject's prefrontal cortex during the task. Using mean signal amplitudes as features and linear discriminant analysis, we were able to decode which drink was preferred on a single-trial basis with an average accuracy of 80\\%.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) indicating that the hemodynamic responses of the right- and left-wrist motor imageries have distinct patterns that can be classified using a linear classifier for the purpose of developing a brain\u2013computer interface (BCI). Ten healthy participants were instructed to imagine kinesthetically the right- or left-wrist flexion indicated on a computer screen. Signals from the right and left primary motor cortices were acquired simultaneously using a multi-channel continuous-wave fNIRS system. Using two distinct features (the mean and the slope of change in the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration), the linear discriminant analysis classifier was used to classify the right- and left-wrist motor imageries resulting in average classification accuracies of 73.35\\% and 83.0\\%, respectively, during the 10s task period. Moreover, when the analysis time was confined to the 2\u20137s span within the overall 10s task period, the average classification accuracies were improved to 77.56\\% and 87.28\\%, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of an fNIRS-based BCI and the enhanced performance of the classifier by removing the initial 2s span and/or the time span after the peak value.",

        "abstract": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that allows the use of brain activity to control computers or other external devices. It can, by bypassing the peripheral nervous system, provide a means of communication for people suffering from severe motor disabilities or in a persistent vegetative state. In this paper, brain-signal generation tasks, noise removal methods, feature extraction/selection schemes, and classification techniques for fNIRS-based BCI are reviewed. The most common brain areas for fNIRS BCI are the primary motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex. In relation to the motor cortex, motor imagery tasks were preferred to motor execution tasks since possible proprioceptive feedback could be avoided. In relation to the prefrontal cortex, fNIRS showed a significant advantage due to no hair in detecting the cognitive tasks like mental arithmetic, music imagery, emotion induction, etc. In removing physiological noise in fNIRS data, band-pass filtering was mostly used. However, more advanced techniques like adaptive filtering, independent component analysis (ICA), multi optodes arrangement, etc. are being pursued to overcome the problem that a band-pass filter cannot be used when both brain and physiological signals occur within a close band. In extracting features related to the desired brain signal, the mean, variance, peak value, slope, skewness, and kurtosis of the noised-removed hemodynamic response were used. For classification, the linear discriminant analysis method provided simple but good performance among others: support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), artificial neural network, etc. fNIRS will be more widely used to monitor the occurrence of neuro-plasticity after neuro-rehabilitation and neuro-stimulation. Technical breakthroughs in the future are expected via bundled-type probes, hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI, and through the detection of initial dips.",

Only in recent years researchers have begun to study the neural correlates that subtend VR experiences. Even if the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is the most common and used technique, it suffers several limitations and problems. Here we present a methodology that involves the use of a new and growing brain imaging technique, functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), while participants experience immersive VR. In order to allow a proper fNIRS probe application, a custom-made VR helmet was created. To test the adapted helmet, a virtual version of the line bisection task was used. Participants could bisect the lines in a virtual peripersonal or extrapersonal space, through the manipulation of a Nintendo Wiimote \u00ae controller in order for the participants to move a virtual laser pointer. Although no neural correlates of the dissociation between peripersonal and extrapersonal space were found, a significant hemodynamic activity with respect to the baseline was present in the right parietal and occipital areas. Both advantages and disadvantages of the presented methodology are discussed.",

The evaluation or success of BCI technologies is often based on how accurate the control of a user is with the technology. However, while this is still key to its usability, other factors that influence the user experience (UX) can make or break a technology. In this paper we first review studies which investigated user experience with BCIs. Second, we will discuss how HCI approaches can contribute to the evaluation of BCIs.

(Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability;there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs;individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; andindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.",
